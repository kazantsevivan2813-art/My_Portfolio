#### 1. Start with an issue:

Use issues to highlight bugs or feature requests, explaining the problem you aim
to solve and its significance.

#### 2. Begin small:

Instead of tackling large tasks immediately, start small to develop skills and
familiarize yourself with different codebase sections and the project’s
workflow.

#### 3.Seek help without hesitation:

Don’t hesitate to ask for assistance when stuck. Provide details on attempted
solutions or ideas.

#### 4. Practice patience:

Understand that reviewing and merging contributions might take time. Stay
motivated and continue working on other tasks.

#### 5.Embrace constructive criticism:

View feedback as a chance to enhance coding skills rather than a personal
critique.

#### 6. Learn from merged pull requests:

Study successfully merged requests to understand effective contributions and
learn from them.

#### 7. Familiarize with project guidelines:

Read and adhere to the project’s contributing guidelines to streamline your pull
request process.

#### 8. Choose an engaging project:

Invest time in projects that genuinely interest you and align with your passions
and skills.

#### 9. Engage with the community:

Join the project’s contributor community to build relationships and facilitate
smoother pull request acceptance.

#### 10. Enjoy the journey:

Embrace the learning experience. Contributing to open source projects is an
opportunity for skill development and networking. Have fun along the way!

Thank you very much. 🎉
