## Perface

Now, there are many, too many freelancers who work on freelancing websites such
as Fiverr, Guru, Upwork, and Freelancer.

Each site has a lot of freelancers, as well as many highly-rated freelancers, so
it can be very hard for a newbie freelancer to get a job from them.

Then, how can write a winning bid and get the client’s attention? What is the
secret to attracting clients?

I have found 8 methods from my testing.

First, I asked 40 freelancers to create a new Upwork account. Then, I sent them
the link of most recent job postings so they could bid on them.

After 2 hours of testing, I found results that were so amazing I couldn’t
believe them.

### 1. Please make client to view your proposal.

Most of clients (especially who are not familiar with the project) will not read
bids in the final section, so if you have written a great proposal but the
client can’t see it, it is useless.

I discovered four crucial things to gather attention of clients.

Yes, there are proposals that have been sent too quickly, proposals that have
been given a boost, proposals that have been highlighted, and the freelancer
avatar.

Now, the client has seen your proposal, but they chose to go with another
freelancer instead of you. Why do you think that happened?

### 2. Please read client’s requirements carefully.

Some clients add special words or phrases as keyword to check freelancers have
read their proposal or not.

If you bid without considering client’s keywords and requirements, how will they
think?

Yes, of course, they will think like this: “This is a bidding bot.”

It is essential to pay attention to the needs of the client.

It would be beneficial if you have experience what clients want, or have already
achieved tangible results that you can show to client.

### 3. If possible, Please include client’s name in your proposal.

Generally, if someone who doesn’t know you knows your name, and then uses your
name in conversation with you, it makes you so glad.

It demonstrates an interest in the client and informs them that you have already
done research about them. (I had a feeling I might be wrong, but the results
confirmed that I was right. 😁)

If a client has a working history on Upwork, then you will have the possibility
of finding his name.

### 4. Please answer all of your client’s questions.

There are such strict and demanding clients, they want to choose the best suited
freelancer.

It could be your most stressful experience, but it could also be an important
step in making you more professional.

If you think it is so cranky, and then ignore this, client will think you are
not a suitable freelancer.

### 5. Please provide links that are similar to what the client wants.

If you can provide links to evidence of your previous work, such as your Github,
StackOverflow, or Medium profiles, that would be helpful to client choose you.

Your live link that is similar to what the client is looking for makes you a
strong candidate. (The most important thing is that you must prove that this is
your own work, otherwise it would make you look like a scammer.)

### 6. Don’t use template proposal.

Some freelancers already have too many pre-written proposals. However, sending a
template proposal does not usually meet the client’s needs.

Further, if you send a template proposal too quickly, clients will have doubts
about whether you are a bot or not.

Do not submit a bid that is just a copy and paste of a template; some
freelancing sites can detect this and it will indicate that you are a bot.

### 7. Make your avatar looks good.

I asked how to select a good avatar for my freelancer profile on ChatGPT.

The result is below.

> ###### 1. A good suggestion would be to look for a photo that shows a natural, genuine smile with slightly upturned corners of the mouth.
>
> ###### 2. Choose a professional-looking profile photo. Make sure the image is clear and in focus, and that it shows your face.
>
> ###### 3. Choose a background image that reflects your professional goals. A graphic, a landscape, or an abstract pattern are all good options.
>
> ###### 4. Use the same photo and bio across all of your social media accounts. This will help potential clients recognize you and make it easier for them to reach out.

### 8. Make your good profile

There are too many good ideas out there. So the best way to go about creating an
amazing profile is to look at the profiles of successful freelancers and use
them as a model.

In a nutshell, using kernel bids (that are neither too short nor too long) to
match all client requests is the key to writing a successful winning bid.

Thank you very much. 🎉
